                cardcontent:"<p> Comprising 28 states and 8 union territories, India is the third-largest Asian nation and the largest democratic nation in the world. India has about 1,632 different languages and dialects, and the Constitution lists 22 official languages. India has been a rich hub of multiculturalism and cultural diversity. It is home to policies of legal pluralism in religious family law (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and Parsi to name a few), territorial autonomy for several linguistic and indigenous groups, safeguarding the rights of sexual and gender minorities, as well as quotas in legislatures, government jobs and educational institutions for caste and tribal minorities. The Indian Constitution has been hailed as a prescient model of multicultural accommodation for its recognition of a range of group-differentiated rights within a broadly liberal democratic framework. It is also home to diverse and extensive civilisation. India has an eventful history and is widely known and respected worldwide. It is also revered in the East as the land of wisdom and came to be known as the land of wealth in the West. India’s grandeur was widely acknowledged by the name of ‘Son Chidiya’ that was given to it because of its existing wealth and diversity of culture. Another aspect of Indian culture is the architecture and the art of the country. India has always had a variety of architecture like Hindu architecture, Indo-Islamic architecture, Rajput architecture etc. Monuments such as the Taj Mahal, Chittor Fort, Lotus Temple etc. depict the vastness of the culture and centuries of History.<br><br> Located in the northwestern part of India, Punjab, the land of five rivers, is home to a rich heritage, and its diversification and uniqueness are reflected in Punjabi folklore, poetry, philosophy, spirituality, music, cuisine, architecture, artistry, and traditions among many other things. The state has given birth to numerous valiant freedom fighters such as Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh, and Sukhdev, who sacrificed their lives for the independence of India. Punjab is a major agriculture-based state. Additionally, it is the highest wheat-producing state in India. Punjab is also known for celebrating various religious, seasonal, and harvesting festivities such as Lohri, Baisakhi, and Basant Panchami. Its major cities are Ludhiana in the central region, Amritsar in the northwest, Jalandhar in the north-central Punjab, Patiala in the southeast, and Bathinda in the south-central part of the state. Due to the two- fifths of Punjab’s population working in agriculture, Punjab contributes a significant amount of the wheat and rice stock maintained by the Central Pool and produces a significant amount of India’s food grain. Aside from agriculture, Punjab is also a rich hub of manufacturing and industrial sectors such as wool, processed foods and beverages, metal products and machinery, transport equipment, leather goods, chemicals, hosiery and furniture. Punjab is also the land of a remarkable spiritual movement, as the Sikh religion bloomed here many years ago. The Sikh Gurus have inspired, guided, motivated, and moulded the culture of Punjab to a great extent. Whenever anybody talks about Punjab, the first thing that comes to mind is the Golden Temple in Amritsar. It is not just a temple or a tourist spot, but the biggest cultural heritage of the Sikh community, as well as one of the biggest assets of the Indian subcontinent.<br><br> About Jalandhar: <br> <ul><li>>> Since the 13th century, Jalandhar has been a significant military and economic hub.</li> <li>>>Globally, Jalandhar has been recognized as one of the largest sports manufacturing hubs.</li> <li>>>The National Institute of Technology, Punjab Institute of Medical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, and numerous other institutes with an overall enrollment of more than 50,000 students have made Jalandhar an enriching centre for education.</li><li>>>In Asia, Jalandhar boasts the highest per-capita availability of healthcare facilities and is renowned for its leather products, hand tools, and bus body manufacturing sectors.</li> <li>>>Jalandhar is a native land of international cricket and hockey players such as Harbhajan Singh and Manpreet Singh, as well as some famous actors, poets, artists, singers, writers, politicians, and military generals.</li></ul></p>",
